Solomon Schechter School of Westchester was founded in 1966 with twenty two students and two teachers in the basement of Temple Israel Center. Rabbi Max Gelb, the school's founder, guided the school with his wife, founding principal Leah Gelb. By the end of the 1970s, enrollment reached 150 and the kindergarten was housed in a converted home adjacent to the main building. It is named after Solomon Schechter, who founded the United Synagogue of America and was the architect of the American Conservative Jewish movement.
